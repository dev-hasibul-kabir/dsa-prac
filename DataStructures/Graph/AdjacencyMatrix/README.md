# Adjacency Matrix
**Adjacency Matrix** is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph by storing the relationships between the nodes in their respective cells. For a graph with V vertices, the adjacency matrix A is an V Ã— V matrix or 2D array.

```
     0  1  2  3
  0 [0, 1, 1, 0]
  1 [1, 0, 0, 1]
  2 [1, 0, 0, 0]
  3 [0, 1, 0, 0]

```
