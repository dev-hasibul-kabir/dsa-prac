# Level Order Traversal [BFS] - Binary Tree 
Level order traversal, also known as Breadth-First Search (BFS) for trees, is a method of traversing a binary tree where all nodes at a particular level are visited before moving to the next deeper level. This means the traversal proceeds level by level, from the root down, and within each level, nodes are visited from left to right. 
### How it works:
- Start at the root: The traversal begins by visiting the root node (Level 0).
- Process current level: All nodes at the current level are visited from left to right.
- Move to the next level: After all nodes at the current level have been visited, the traversal moves to the next deeper level.
- Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until all nodes in the tree have been visited.
